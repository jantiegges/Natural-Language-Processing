# Natural Language Processing 

This repository contains assignments for a university course on Natural Language Processing (NLP) around the topics of text classification, word sense disambiguation and machine translation.

## Programming Assignments

### Programming Assignment 1: Linear Classifiers
In this assignment, the use of different linear classifiers as well as the impact of different choices regarding preprocessing and hyperparameters was investigated based on a toy experiment. The task was to classify short statements about animals whether it is a true or an imaginary one. The primary research question was to find out whether linear classifiers are suitable for such tasks and which effect the choice of a classifier has

### Programming Assignment 2: Word Sense Disambiguation
This report presents a study on the disambiguation of word meanings using four different methods: Baseline of frequent meanings, Lesk algorithm, BERT model and a bootstrapping approach. The report dives into potential reasons of the results and discusses the limitations of the methods.

## Reading Assignments

### Reading Assignment 1: Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification by Zhang et al. (2015)
The paper presents a novel approach to text classification using character-level convolutional networks (CNNs). The authors show that CNNs can achieve competitive results on several text classification tasks without any prior knowledge of words, phrases, or other linguistic features. The authors also show that CNNs can be very efficient.

### Reading Assignment 2: Grammar as a Foreign Language by Vinyals et al. (2015) 
The paper presents a novel approach to machine translation using a sequence-to-sequence learning model. The authors show that their model can be used to translate English sentences into French sentences. The authors also show that their model can be used to translate English sentences into programming languages such as Python and C++.

### Reading Assignment 3: Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC)
The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) is a test of machine intelligence proposed by Hector Levesque, Ernest Davis, and Leora Morgenstern in 2011. The test is designed to be an improvement over the Turing test, which is a test of machine intelligence proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. The WSC is designed to be an improvement over the Turing test because it is more difficult for a machine to pass the WSC than it is for a machine to pass the Turing test.
